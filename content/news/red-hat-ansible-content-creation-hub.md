### Smart Scalable & Sharable Automation

The world as we know it has changed, and therefore so has the way in which we need to operate within it.
Enterprises not only need the ability to easily create automation, but they also need to be able to share and reuse automation across projects and teams with the right level of governance and control.

### Welcome to seamless automation with Red Hat Ansible

Ansible Automation Platform provides an enterprise framework for building and operating IT automation at scale, from hybrid cloud to the edge. Ansible Automation Platform enables users across an organization to create, share, and manage automationâ€”from development and operations to security and network teams.

IT managers can provide guidelines on how automation is applied to individual teams, and automation creators can write tasks that use existing knowledge. Ansible Automation Platform provides a more secure and stable foundation for deploying end-to-end automation.

### Why choose Ansible for automation?
