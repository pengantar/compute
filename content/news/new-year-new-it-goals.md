2022 will see businesses continue to modernize the workplace and rethink workflows to optimize for hybrid working arrangements. As we plan to return to the office, it is clear remote work will continue in greater numbers than ever before. This will result in a split audience, with some employees in the office while others carry on from home. To level the playing field, new technology solutions and space redesigns will be adopted for hybrid collaboration. - Shaheen Yazdani, Intercept.

### 3. Increased Workplace Automation

The Internet of Things, AI and automation will help businesses fill gaps created by the labor shortage while optimizing staff. In retail and hospitality, this will take the form of self-serve kiosks, autonomous order fulfillment and AI-enabled drive-thrust, all freeing people up for higher-skilled roles. Adoption will continue to accelerate as the positive business impact of improved efficiency and staff morale is recognized. - Joe Jensen, Intel Corporation. We are here for you!

Recovery and Network Infrastructure in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Zambia.
Seamless access across a global company’s multiple data silos will only get more difficult in 2022, as data volumes and sources continue to explode. Businesses will look for modern platforms and approaches, such as data fabrics, that bring the composable stack and distributed data together. Finding ways to integrate siloed data for actionable insights will be top of mind for businesses in 2022. - Scott Gnau, Intersystems. Call us for your Data Center, Infrastructure support, WAN & LAN support, Non-IT DC Infra, and maintenance services.

### 5. Digital Twin Technology

Digital twins are changing every industry. They enable real-time, virtual representations of physical objects, processes and even operations. They serve as a catalyst for any simulation, helping you eliminate the time and cost of developing complex products, predict and adapt to real-time changes, automate routine tasks, and more. A digital thread closes the loop, creating universal access to data. - Çağlayan Arkan, Microsoft Corporation.

### 6. Enhanced Search Optimization

Many companies are employing search optimization techniques that are similar to what was used in 2010, despite knowing that search is imperative to their customer experience. From streaming to shopping, the biggest tech trend to anticipate in 2022 is the explosion of search and discovery strategies that both inspire and fill a need for the customer. - Bernadette Nixon, Algolia.

One trend we see in healthcare is the use of technology to create closer human connections. High-tech can also be high-touch. Examples include personalized patient outreach based on where someone is in their healthcare journey or ongoing monitoring via remote devices. Virtual health sessions will bring providers closer to their patients in a more intimate setting for care delivery—the patient’s home. - Puneet Maheshwari, DocASAP Inc.

I fully expect to see sales from social media rise in the next year due to this trend. - Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster.

Digital transformation is here to stay. For example, documents you work with today likely originated as digital files and will only ever exist in digital form. Digitally native assets contain important metadata; they form relationships with other digital assets, and they are also more actionable. In other words, digitization adds powerful layers of insight and newly verifiable authenticity. - Olga V. Mack, Parley Pro.

### 10. Marketing Through Connected TV

Connected TV will play an enormous role in 2022 for both businesses and consumers, and not just because of its growing popularity. Between data-driven targeting and advanced measurements, CTV has matured into a powerful medium to reach and engage with relevant consumers. Research by the Interactive Advertising Bureau found that 60% of marketers said they were shifting ad dollars from broadcast TV to CTV in 2021; I’m only surprised the number isn’t higher. - Chris Paquette, DeepIntent.
