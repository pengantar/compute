### History of International Computer Security Day

This important day in computer history was first celebrated in 1988 to make awareness of computer security. It was the time when computers became common worldwide, especially with the increased use of computers in business industries and government operations which hosted a large amount of sensitive user data & information.

At that point, the internet was in its genesis stage. During the early days of modern computers; hacking was not a common trend and most computer viruses were engineered as a prank. This all changed after the Internet boom. There was a rapid development in modern-day technologies, which in turn led to an increase in the number of applications. Furthermore, the worldwide web, connected everyone across the globe further escalating the rate at which viruses were shared across the global network.

Therefore, the Security risks began due to the usage of computers in banks, private sectors, government offices, etc., Data usage by computer devices grew exponentially thus increasing the risk of cyber-attacks. This dynamic shift into data vulnerability made this holiday a canon day to sensitize the public on how to reduce risk and keep data secure on any device, at any time.
